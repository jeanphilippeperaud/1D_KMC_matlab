A simple 1D time-dependent linearized phonon transport problem solved with the Kinetic Monte Carlo method

The system is a slab of Si material (dispersion and relaxation time data are located in the file dataSi.txt) 
of width L, with imposed tempeartures on both sides. The method makes use of the kinetic type algorithm
developed in :
